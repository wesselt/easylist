Easylist Privacy Policy
=======================

The goal of this website is to facilitate access to a few functions of the
BUNQ API.  The facilitated access is provided through an URL with a unique
identifier (GUID).  This website collects as little data as possible to
facilitate this access.  This page details the information that is stored and 
used after you've linked your BUNQ account.

Information Stored
------------------
- The URL identified by its GUID
- The BUNQ tokens BUNQ sends for OAUTH (code, bearer, installation, 
  session, etc)
- The time a URL is created and updated

Information Not Stored (not even in log files)
----------------------------------------------
- BUNQ transactions
- BUNQ account information (IBANS, balance, names, etc)

This information is requested from the BUNQ API but not stored beyond the time
it takes to answer an HTTP request.

Third Parties
-------------
No data is sent to a third party.  Easylist does not use any analytics
service or third party tracker.

Log Files
---------
Log files aid in troubleshooting and debugging.  For example, the nginx log
contains incoming HTTP calls.  The mod_uswgi log contain debug output from
the Python module. Log files are kept for 14 days or less.
